# Hey there! 👋 Welcome to My Portfolio

Hey! I'm Anmol, a second-year undergrad at Universal College of Engineering, just diving deep into the vast ocean of tech. This is my little corner of the internet where I showcase who I am and what I do (or at least, what I’m trying to do 😆).

## 🌍 What’s This About?
This is my personal portfolio website! It's super simple right now, but hey, I'm just getting started. The goal is to keep improving as I learn more about web dev, AI, and everything in between.

## 🏗 What’s Inside?
Here’s a quick breakdown of the project:
```
 tecanmol-portfolio/
 ├── CNAME  # Custom domain setup (anmol.is-a.dev)
 ├── index.html  # Main HTML file
 ├── css/
 │   ├── bootstrap-icons.css  # Icons styling
 │   └── style.css  # Main styling file
 ├── fonts/
 │   ├── bootstrap-icons.woff  # Font file for icons
 │   └── bootstrap-icons.woff2  # Another font file
 └── images/
     ├── background.png  # Background image
     ├── profile.png  # My profile picture
```

## 🎨 Features (For Now...)
✅ A sleek glassmorphism-styled card layout.  
✅ A dark-themed UI (because light mode is too mainstream).  
✅ Social media links so you can stalk—uh, I mean, connect with me. 😅  
✅ Mobile-friendly (hopefully 🤞).  

## 🔧 Future Plans
- Make the site more interactive (maybe a blog? 🤔)
- Add some cool animations.
- Experiment with AI integrations.
- Just keep improving (and breaking things along the way 😂).

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- HTML & CSS (Basic, but gotta start somewhere)
- Bootstrap Icons (Because I love fancy icons)
- Pure passion and a sprinkle of curiosity 💡
